# Malicious_Account_Detection-using-ANN
Malicious account detection using artificial neural networks (ANNs) is a technique that involves training a model to identify fraudulent or malicious user accounts in online platforms. The model analyzes various user activity patterns and behavioral data to detect anomalies and classify accounts as malicious or genuine. This project demonstrates the potential of machine learning algorithms in enhancing the security of online platforms and has practical applications in various domains, such as social media platforms, online banking, and e-commerce websites.
